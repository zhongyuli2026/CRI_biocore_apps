  p("Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful tool for uncovering cellular diversity and understanding tissue composition at high resolution. Critical information about biological differences at the cellular level can be obtained by comparing scRNA-seq datasets (treatment vs. control). We used R Shiny to create scVizApp (Single-cell Visualization Application), which enables users to easily explore and interpret scRNA-seq data, in order to make such analysis more accessible.",br(),
  
"Our application focuses on comparative exploration by enabling users to visualize cell populations under various experimental conditions and interactively modify metadata. Regardless of the experiment model, users can create and examine Multi-Dimensional Plots, Feature Plots, Violin Plots, and Dot Plots by merely uploading an RDS/Rdata file.",br(),
